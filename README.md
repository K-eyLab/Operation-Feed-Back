Operation Feed-Back is a student-led campaign founded in October, 2024. 

We aim to raise awareness on stifling impacts from tutors’ negative feedback. 

These careless remarks caused a hostile work environment, where students are under obligation to perform normally, even when their confidence is breached, constantly experience non-constructive criticism, complete disapproval and being disregarded.

Our goal is to reach a consensus with Central Saint Martins administration and management team, to enforce long-term effective policy, in purpose to standardise staff’s feedback delivery process.
