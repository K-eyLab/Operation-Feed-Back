# Operation-Feed-Back
Website: feed-back.net


Operation Feed-Back is a student-led campaign founded in October,2024. 

We make complaints to raise awareness on stifling impacts from tutors feedback, which created a hostile work environment; where the students are required to perform normally even under negative influence. 

Our goal is to reach agreement with Central Saint Martins, to enforce long-term effective policy in standardization of feedback delivery process.
