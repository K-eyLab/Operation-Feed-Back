This letter is from an international student campaign at Central St.Martins, Operation Feed-back(d_b_op), bringing attention to student right of speech and problematic teaching staff on site. 
.
Our campaign reached out to college management, the Dean through our school representative, but there has been a delay in the college response.
.
We hope you can represent us and address this topic in tomorrow Court Meeting to some extent. 
Please browse the following files from our GitHub: 

1. Translated International Students reports, 
2. Anonymous reports from Rate My Professor Website.
3. Proposal of Feed-back Coverage(FC) Policy.

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Sincerely,
